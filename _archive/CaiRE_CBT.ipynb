    "In cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), when you're asked to identify unhelpful thoughts that contribute to a specific situation or issue, you are essentially being encouraged to recognize and analyze your negative or distorted thought patterns associated with that issue. Here's how you can approach this question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the Situation/Issue: Start by clearly defining the situation or issue you want to work on. For example, it could be anxiety in social situations, procrastination, or low self-esteem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognize Negative Thoughts: Think about the thoughts that go through your mind when you experience this issue. These are often automatic or subconscious thoughts that may be irrational or unhelpful. They can be self-critical, overly pessimistic, or unrealistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze Negative Thoughts: Once you've identified these thoughts, try to analyze them. Ask yourself questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are these thoughts based on evidence or facts?\n",
    "- Are they extreme or exaggerated?\n",
    "- Do they lead to unhelpful emotions or behaviors?\n",
    "- Do they involve self-criticism or harsh judgments?\n",
    "- Challenge Negative Thoughts: After recognizing and analyzing these thoughts, you can begin to challenge them. - - - Challenge means questioning the validity of these thoughts. Are there alternative, more balanced, or rational thoughts that might be more helpful in the situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reframe Thoughts: Try to reframe your unhelpful thoughts into more balanced, realistic, and constructive ones. This process is about changing the way you think about the situation, which can lead to changes in your emotions and behaviors.\n"
