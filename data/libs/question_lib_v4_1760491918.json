That is tough, and you are not alone in this.\n\nA few gentle, flexible ideas you could try:\n- Use flexible meal windows instead of strict times (e.g., a morning, mid-day, and evening window). If work is hectic, aim to eat something within each window.\n- Set simple reminders or calendar nudges on your phone or computer to pause and check: Did I eat or drink water?\n- Keep portable, balanced snacks within reach (nuts, yogurt, fruit, cheese sticks, protein bars) for when you forget to eat.\n- Prep 1-2 easy go-to meals on calmer days (or keep ready-to-eat options) so you can grab food fast when your schedule shifts.\n- Pair eating with an existing work habit (e.g., after your first meeting, after sending a report, or when you refill your water).\n- If possible, block a short 10-15 minute buffer in your calendar as a non-meeting time to eat, even if the exact time moves.\n\nSince you mentioned it has started to affect your health, consider a quick check-in with a healthcare professional to rule out any issues and get personalized guidance.
