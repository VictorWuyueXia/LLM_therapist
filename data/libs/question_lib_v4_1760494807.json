Noticing that it has started to affect your health is important, and I am glad you shared it.\n\nA few small, doable steps could help without fighting your workflow:\n- Set 2-3 gentle calendar reminders or phone alarms as nudges to pause for food.\n- Anchor eating to work cues: a snack right after a meeting, or lunch when you send a key email.\n- Keep easy, ready-to-eat options at your desk or bag (nuts, yogurt, cheese sticks, fruit, protein bars, instant oatmeal).\n- On hectic days, aim for a minimum baseline: one solid meal plus two snack-sized mini-meals.\n- Use hydration as a cue: every time you refill your water, take a quick bite.\n- Since you mentioned health effects, consider tracking what you eat and any symptoms for a week and check in with a healthcare professional if the effects continue.\n\nIf you want, we can build a simple 10-minute meal-and-snack plan around your typical busy windows.
